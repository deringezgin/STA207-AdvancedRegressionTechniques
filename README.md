# STA207 Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository has most of my work for the Advaced Regression Techniques course at Connecticut College, taught by [Priya Kohli](https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/priya-kohli/)

The class is an introduction to advanced regression techniques used in data analysis. Students begin with simple and multiple linear regression, then wokr on topics like model diagnostics, transforming variables, weighted least squares, and logistic regression. The course inlucdes a semester-long data-analysis-project, making use of R to analyze and interpret real-world data.
